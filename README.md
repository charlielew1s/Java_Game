# Java_Game
## Introduction
During term two of my first year computer science studies at City, University of London, I completed an assessment graded by my university. The assessment was to create a game in Java using a physics engine library provided by my university, which as the name suggests, simulates real physics, for example when placing an object at the top of the field of view of gameplay, it would fall to the bottom of the field of view as if gravity was pulling it down.

## Brief game description

My idea for a game was very original and I incorporated my love of K-pop (South Korean pop music) into the task. The game was divided up into three unique levels. Each level consisted of public figures who hate K-pop (haters) and public figures who like K-pop (supporters) falling from the sky out of an imaginary helicopter that in the game plot is located outside the field of view.

## Level One

During the first level, a K-pop singer, Sunmi drives a cannon. On the player's request, the cannon will shoot a projectile. Every time the projectile hits a falling hater, the player's score will increase by 100. If the projectile hits a falling supporter, however the score will fall by 100. If the score falls below 0, the player will have failed the level and will need to restart the level.

## Level Two

During the second level, Sunmi moves across the field of view with a net placed on top of her head. Every time Sunmi catches a supporter in the net, the score increases by 100. If a hater lands in the net, however, the player will have to restart the level, since the hater will kill all the supporters.

## Level Three

During the third level, Sunmi does not appear. Rather, there are three stationary guns mounted on a wall that shoot projectiles on the player's request. As the haters and supporters fall from the sky, the projectiles must hit the haters. Just as in the first level, the score will increment by 100 if the projectile hits a hater and decrement by 100 if it hits a supporter. If the score falls below 0, the player will have failed the level and will need to restart the level.

## The intrinsic value of this game and it's relevance to my wider computer science aspirations

This game allowed me to raise awareness of a critical and under - discussed global issue - the bullying and mistreatment of K-pop fans in society. Part of the reason why I have chosen to study computer science is that being part of the K-pop community but also identifying as male, I have learned by reading what my fellow fans have posted online about the dangers that its majority non-male and minor fanbase suffer from and fear, such as cyberbullying and sexual predators. I hope to use the power of code to help make the internet a safer place for everyone.
